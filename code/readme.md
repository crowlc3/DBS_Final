retrive_data.py Notes and Instructions:
	
	When retriving the data you want to verify that 4 files are downloaded under the following names:
		leukemias.csv
		lung.csv
		melanomas.csv
		Title_V_Emissions_Inventory__Beginning_2010.csv

	The first three files listed above are not downloading from their original source. The original link found in our proposal
	creates temporary download links from dynamic user options entered on this page. This rendered it impossible to ensure
	retrieve_data.py could download from their site. So we downloaded the three files manually and are hosting them on Chris's 
	webserver. (The downloads were also 'blob:' types which did not play nice with the code in retrieve_data.py.)
