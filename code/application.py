#-------------Heres some ideas for queries-------------------#



# - At least two queries that select at least some data from both of your datasets

#*****Toxins*****
# Select the toxins levels per country
# Select the amount of a specific toxin in all counties

#*****Cancers*****
# Select the data from each type of cancer


# - At least two queries that showcase syntax beyond the basic `SELECT-FROM-WHERE` clauses (e.g., Grouping, Subqueries, etc.)

#*****Toxins*****
# Join Cancer on county

#*****Cancers*****
# Select the data with cases over a certain threshold


# - At least two queries that accept input entered by the user (as opposed to just allowing selection from a list of options)

#*****Toxins*****
# Select the amount of toxins for a specific county

#*****Cancers*****
# Select the data for a specific county
