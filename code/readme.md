toxins_raw vs toxins:


re-hosting 3 files:
Website was using non-static download links as a wide range of input had to be made before you could get your desired data.
The downloads were also blob: types which did not play nice with the code in retrieve_data.py.
So I have hosted them as the CSV downloads on my website.
